# About Me
I'm a graduate student at [Stanford University](http://stanford.edu), where I'm studying Electrical Engineering with an emphasis on signal and image processing.  I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [Oklahoma Christian University](http://oc.edu) in the spring of 2012.

In my free time, I enjoy just about anything outside.  Most often, it's hiking, cycling, running, sailing, or [geocaching](http://geocaching.com).  I'm proud to not own a car (for now), and am happy getting around on my bike.  I enjoy technical projects, especially anything where I can pull out a soldering iron or a wrench and also write some code.  I was heavily involved in [FIRST LEGO League](http://firstlegoleague.com) and the [FIRST Robotics Competition](http://usfirst.org/frc) as a student, and continued to mentor a team in college.

# Contact
The easiest way to contact me is by email: sebell _ stanford _ edu.  You can also find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/stevenebell) or (if you know me in real life) [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/botsnlinux).

# About this site
This site is an attempt to pull together my many projects, ideas, and writings, and fill a role that a blog or Facebook can't.

On the technical side, the site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to produce static HTML.  You can read a little more about the development process in my TODO BLOG POST
{ post_url 2012-07-08-building-the-site } .

I've tried a variety of setups in the past, including plain-vanilla HTML, a custom PHP setup, and [Jemdoc](http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/).  I'm also attracted to the ease-of-use that WordPress offers, but right now I really like the simplicity of plain text and the idea of having my website be a version-controlled repository.
