# About Me

I'm an Assistant Teaching Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Tufts University](http://tufts.edu), where I teach a mix of topics including embedded programming, computer architecture, and imaging systems.
I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering from [Stanford University](http://ee.stanford.edu), and my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [Oklahoma Christian University](http://oc.edu).

My PhD research was at the intersection of computer architecture, software systems, and image processing: building systems capable of capturing images with microsecond timing constraints and processing them in real time with the energy budget of a mobile device.
These days, most of my effort is on teaching, and I've become very interested in engineering education --- using research methods to better understand how students think and aquire engineering skills.
I like to build stuff with my hands and take things apart to figure out how they work.  If you're a Tufts student and like to take electronics apart, we should talk. :-)

# Contact
The best way to contact me is by email: steven.bell _ tufts _ edu.  To minimize distraction, I only check email a couple times a day, but I make an attempt to answer most messages within a day or two.

# About this site
This site began as an attempt to pull together my many projects, ideas, and writings, in a way that Facebook or a standalone blog could not.  Now that I've moved into professional life, it's evolving to take on that role as well.

On the technical side, the site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to produce static HTML.  You can read a little more about the development process in my [blog post](/2012-07-17/building-the-site/).

I've tried a variety of setups in the past, including plain-vanilla HTML, a custom PHP setup, and [Jemdoc](http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/).  I'm also attracted to the ease-of-use that WordPress offers, but right now I really like the simplicity of plain text and the idea of having my website be a version-controlled repository.
