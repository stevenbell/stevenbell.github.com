# Research interests
I'm presently a graduate student in Electrical Engineering at [Stanford University](http://stanford.edu).  My interests are in the areas of signal and image processing, computational photography, imaging, and computer vision.  I enjoy projects at the intersection of hardware, software, and theory, where the math produces a beautiful and tangible result.

I'm currently working with [Mark Horowitz](http://stanford.edu/~horowitz) on the [Camera 2.0](http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/camera-2.0/) project, helping design and build the "Frankencamera F4".  Our goal is to build a powerful and standard platform for computational photography research, building on the existing [FCam API](http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/fcam/html/).

# Work experience
I worked at NVIDIA Research during the summers of 2012 and 2013.  I augmented FCam with a new device class for inertial sensors (gyroscopes and accelerometers) and used this to explore real-time rolling shutter correction on Android devices.  Building on this work, I developed a new algorithm for video stabilization using the motion information from a gyroscope.

I spent parts of three summers at BAE Systems, Inc.  I was involved in a variety of projects, including building an IMU-assisted image registration system, developing a  test application for submarine sonar units, configuring and testing USRP software radios, and building a MATLAB distributed computing cluster.
