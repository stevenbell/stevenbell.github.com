# Projects
Although most of my projects have some technical bent, the projects which are primarily software are located on the [code](code.html) page.

# OpenStreetMap
I am contributor to the OpenStreetMap project, which aims to create a freely-editable map of the world, akin to Wikipedia for maps.  In general, I have worked on small areas near where I live, adding buildings and trails, and correcting roads.

# Musquash
The Musquash is a conservation area in Londonderry, NH, where I grew up.  I spent countless days exploring the trails on my bike and on foot, and an equal amount of time learning to use GIS and other cartography tools with the goal of creating an orienteering-quality map of the area.  While the map isn't orienteering quality yet, I've learned an enormous amount from the project, and the Town of Londonderry used my trail shapefiles in their latest map of the area.

#[FIRST Physics](projects/firstphysics)
The FIRST Robotics Competition is an excellent program where teams of high school students build large (5', 150lb) robots to compete in an annual game.  However, since most high school students don't take physics until their senior year, they are missing one of the most valuable tools for designing effective robots.

The goal of this project is to introduce the key physics concepts which are important to building a robot, and to do so in a way that is simple, engaging, and relevant. 

#Songbook
It seems that nearly every church I've been a part of has attempted to make a song book with newer songs, generally labeled the "teen song book" or "college book".  Unfortunately, compiling these books require an enormous amount of effort, and they tend to be riddled with typographic errors.  More often than not, the songs are typed by hand from memory, and important details like attribution and copyright get ignored.

My objective is to create an online tool which can easily produce these types of song books, hopefully reducing the amount of duplicated effort and creating a higher-quality final product.  I'm also doing my best to track down the attribution and copyright for each song, so that credit (and possibly royalties, in some cases) can be given where it is due.
