# Hi, I'm Steven!

I'm delighted to be starting as a Lecturer in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Tufts University](http://tufts.edu) in September 2018.
Until then, I'm wrapping up my PhD at [Stanford University](http://stanford.edu) and planning an epic move across the country with my family.

## Presenting at ASEE
I'm presenting on [Stanford's ENGR 40M](http://engr40m.stanford.edu), "An Introduction to Making" at the 2018 ASEE annual conference.  The basic goal was to make an introductory electrical engineering class more interesting and useful for the non-majors who were taking it by centering the course around a series of fun and realistic projects.  You can read the [full paper here](http://files.stevenbell.me/papers/asee2018_engr40m.pdf) [PDF, 3.9MB].
