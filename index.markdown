# Hi, I'm Steven!

I'm a Lecturer in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Tufts University](http://tufts.edu), where I teach a mix of topics including embedded programming, computer architecture, and imaging systems.  In Fall 2019, I'm teaching the following courses:

* [EE 200 -- Accelerated programming for graduate students](http://www.ece.tufts.edu/ee/200)
* [EE 193-HIP -- Imaging systems: From photons to bits and back](http://www.ece.tufts.edu/ee/193HIP)
* EE 105 -- Control systems

In Spring 2019, I taught:
* [ES 4 -- Introduction to digital logic circuits](http://www.ece.tufts.edu/es/4)
* [EE 201 -- Fundamentals of computer systems and engineering](http://www.ece.tufts.edu/ee/201)

For a full description of these and other courses, see my [teaching page](teaching).

Office hours for Fall 2019:

* Mondays, 10:30am-12:30pm
* Tuesdays, 3-5pm
* Thursdays, 3-4pm ([walking office hours, route here](walking_oh))

I'm also happy to meet outside of these times; just send me an email and we can schedule something.

## Tufts "Teaching with Technology" award
I received a [2019 Tufts "Teaching with Technology"](https://sites.tufts.edu/ets/2019/05/23/winners-of-the-2019-teaching-with-technology-awards/) award for my work creating [VHDLweb](vhdlweb.com), a tool which lets students write and simulate VHDL code in a web browser.

Traditional simulation tools have substantial installation overhead, making them impractical to use for a quick in-class exercise.  They also have a steep learning curve, meaning that precious cognitive resources which could be focused on learning digital design are instead wasted navigating the peculiarities of the tool.

VHDLweb reduces both of these burdens to zero, allowing students to solve VHDL problems in class, on any device, with nothing to install and nothing sucking their focus from the task of writing code.
You can try it out at [vhdlweb.com](http://vhdlweb.com).  It'll be undergoing heavy construction over the next few months, so don't be surprised if things are broken or the site goes down for a bit.

## ASEE-ECE best paper
In June 2018, I presented on [Stanford's ENGR 40M](http://engr40m.stanford.edu), "An Introduction to Making" at the 2018 ASEE annual conference, which was chosen as the ECE section Best Paper.  The basic goal was to make an introductory electrical engineering class more interesting and useful for the non-majors who were taking it by centering the course around a series of fun and realistic projects.  You can read the [full paper here](http://files.stevenbell.me/papers/asee2018_engr40m.pdf) [PDF, 3.9MB].
