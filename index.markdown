# Hi, I'm Steven!

I'm a Lecturer in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Tufts University](http://tufts.edu), where I teach a mix of topics including embedded programming, computer architecture, and imaging systems.  I am currently teaching:
* [EE 200 -- Accelerated programming for graduate students](http://www.ece.tufts.edu/ee/200)
* [EE 193-HIP -- Imaging systems: From photons to bits and back](http://www.ece.tufts.edu/ee/193HIP)

For a full description of these and other courses, see my [teaching page](teaching).

## ASEE-ECE best paper
In June, I presented on [Stanford's ENGR 40M](http://engr40m.stanford.edu), "An Introduction to Making" at the 2018 ASEE annual conference, which was chosen as the ECE section Best Paper.  The basic goal was to make an introductory electrical engineering class more interesting and useful for the non-majors who were taking it by centering the course around a series of fun and realistic projects.  You can read the [full paper here](http://files.stevenbell.me/papers/asee2018_engr40m.pdf) [PDF, 3.9MB].
