# Finding my office

My office is Halligan 112, next to the EECS systems group and near Emily Carlson and Brian Aull.

Walking around a building trying to find someone's office for the first time can bit a bit daunting, so here's a photo guide to help!

Use the [Tufts campus map](https://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/) to locate Halligan Hall (in between the JCC and the athletic center).

Come in the front entrance, go straight, and take a left:

Go forward and take another left:

<img src="/assets/img/office2.jpg" width="700px"/>

I'm the last door on the right:

Welcome!  It's good to see you!
