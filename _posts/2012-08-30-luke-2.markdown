As we should perhaps expect, God is the primary actor in this passage.  Mary and Joseph are mostly "along for the ride".  That's not to say that they're passively being drug along by the current.  No, they take a role of active obedience and humble servanthood. They are delighted to play such a pivotal role in God's plan, and revel in the fact that God has revealed himself to them.  As the adventure unfolds, Mary "treasures up these things in her heart", and Joseph "marvels at what is said about \[Jesus\]".

Likewise, Simeon is "moved by the Spirit" to go into the temple, where he meets Joseph and Mary holding their son. His literal purpose in life has been for the moment he will see the child.

We would do well to restore this particular sense of awe in our celebration of Christ's birth.  Two thousand years removed, we don't see ourselves as active participants like Mary and Joseph; we simply praise God for sending Jesus to save us.  That should be enough, certainly, but it's even better than that.  God chose to enter the earth as a human being.  He works with people and through people, and he chooses to work with us today.  Our hearts ought to be humble, our feet obedient, and our minds blown as we hang on for the ride.
