# mkpdfs.py -- convert an Inkscape SVG into presentation slides
[mkpdfs.py](https://gist.github.com/stevenbell/909c79c9396f932942476e658b38d80c) (Github gist)

I use [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org) to create most of my presentation slides, since it generally makes it easy to do the things you should (explanatory figures, diagrams, and other visuals) and hard to do the things you shouldn't (slides full of bulleted lists).
Basically, every layer in the document becomes a slide in the resulting presentation.  Read the comments at the top of the file for a more complete description.
